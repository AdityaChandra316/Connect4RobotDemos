# Connect4RobotDemos
Demo videos for robot that plays the game of Connect 4!

I sadly no longer have the python code (I wrote it a couple years ago), and it was only stored on my Raspberry Pi, and there was an issue with the Pi's SD card that it got wiped 🥲 

I do still have the CAD files, which contain the <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/04afde9d3ff6ff1a64e03c4f/w/aad150a92d7e782123369604/e/9ca0c8607b3c86034cced19a?renderMode=0&uiState=69319d072aade48f1d45460b" target="_blank">robot itself</a> and it's <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1e86830b45d8fa9eb5d61b33/w/5343cbfb5f6fdb878641225a/e/06322e7a39f5001e39494233?renderMode=0&uiState=69319e55339ae7ad7bc76c84" target="_blank">camera bracket</a>, within this readme, so anyone should be able 3D print them on their own by exporting the parts!

But I have some demos of it!

My little brother beating the robot (on a lower difficulty using 64 monte-carlo iterations):

The robot beating my little brother (on the max difficulty using (or atleast I think it was) 2048 monte-carlo iterations):

Me playing the robot on max difficulty, in which I lose both times 😔:

Me as red (where it is my turn first)...
