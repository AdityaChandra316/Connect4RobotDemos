# Connect4RobotDemos
Demo videos for robot that plays the game of Connect 4!

I sadly no longer have the code (I wrote it a couple years ago), and it was only stored on my Raspberry Pi, and there was an issue with the Pi's SD card that it got wiped 🥲 I do still have the CAD files, which I have uploaded to this repo, so anyone should be able 3D print them on their own!

But I have some demos of it!

My little brother beating the robot (on a lower difficulty using 64 monte-carlo iterations):
